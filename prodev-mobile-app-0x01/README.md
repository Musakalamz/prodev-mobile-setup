# üé® Mobile Components and Styling Implementation (prodev-mobile-app-0x01)

This repository holds the solution for **Task 2: Implementing Mobile Components in React Native**. The focus was on understanding and utilizing core React Native components (`<View>`, `<Text>`) and applying styles using the JavaScript `StyleSheet` module.

## ‚ú® Objectives Achieved

* **Core Component Usage:** Used native components (`<View>`, `<Text>`) as building blocks, analogous to `<div>` and `<p>` in web development.
* **JavaScript Styling:** Defined all component styles using `StyleSheet.create()` to ensure optimization and maintainability.
* **Styling Properties:** Explored various text styling properties (e.g., `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `fontVariant`) and layout properties (e.g., `backgroundColor`, `textAlign`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details (`app/index.tsx`)

The main application file demonstrates component composition and styling for displaying text elements with distinct styles:

| Component | Style Applied | Text Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main View** | `styles.container` (Background Color) | Root container |
| **Large Text** | `styles.largeText` (30pt, red, small-caps) | "Typescript is great if you practice more" |
| **Medium Text** | `styles.mediumText` (20pt, purple, right-aligned) | "React Native provides you a single codebase for cross platforms" |
| **Small Text** | `styles.smallText` (15pt, blue, center-aligned) | "ALX is awesome" |

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd prodev-mobile-app-0x01`
2.  Run the development server: `npx expo start`
3.  Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app to view the styled components.
